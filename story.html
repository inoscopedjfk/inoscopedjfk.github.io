					Referring back to the original “Death Note” series, Light Yagami, an extremely intelligent high school student plans to use the Death Note, a notebook that allows him to kill anyone by writing the person’s name on it, to rid the world of all evil. As criminals begin to mysteriously die of heart attacks, it catches the attention of interpol and the greatest detective in the world known only by the alias L. I think this is great because we have a protagonist who is not entirely a “good” guy, and every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat, since nothing is predictable. The cat-and-mouse game of L and Light is just pure genius. The series also leaves the audience questioning their ethics. If someone were to do something horrible in order to create something good for everyone else, would it be considered right or wrong? The author does a great job of leaving that question to be answered by the audience themselves and I consider Death Note a true masterpiece. Now back to the novel, Death Note: Another Note The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases, serves as a prequel of the original series. The book is originally in Japanese, and usually when they are translated in English, they are terrible. But surprisingly, the translations were smooth. The story is narrated by Mello, one of L’s successors, and this story is from one of the cases L told him about in his past. He starts out by trying to narrate the story as if he’s making a crime report—very straight forward. As he tells the story, his tone changes when he talks about what the characters are thinking or feeling. He sometimes catches himself and reverts back to the other style. I really like what the author did here because it perfectly captures Mello’s character. </p>
