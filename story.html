					A series of murders begin in the streets of Los Angeles. The murderer seems to be leaving clues behind in each crime scene. These clues lead to the next murder, almost as if he’s taunting the authorities, like he has a mindset of being better than everybody. After the third murder, L, the greatest detective in the world, begins to solve the case. Normally, the requirements for him to take cases are either the reward money is over $1,000,000 or if there are more than 10 victims. Although this case only had 3 victims so far, there’s something about it that made him take it.  He recruits Naomi Misora, an FBI agent on a leave of absence from the bureau, to be his eyes on the case. And during Naomi’s investigation, she bumps into an “unprivate” detective named Rue Ryuzaki who was supposedly hired by the families of the victims. He calls himself an unprivate detective because according to him, the term private detective “carries with it an excess of neurotic egotism, therefore he wants to be called an unprivate detective—a detective without ego. Ryuzaki, although mysterious, is a genius. He, along with Naomi, follow the trail of a complex system of clues the murderer left behind. As they get deeper into the serial killings, it is revealed that Beyond Birthday has a mutual connection to L. They both grew up in Wammy’s House, located in Winchester, England, is an orphanage which was initially a training facility for special gifted children founded after World War II. From this orphanage, L would then become the greatest detective. Because of L’s success as a detective, the goal of the Wammy House would then become to produce a successor to L. Beyond Birthday, under the alias B, happened to be one of L’s first successors. Sick of being treated as a “backup” or a “copy” of L, B ran away from the orphanage. Rather than becoming the greatest detective in the world, B decides to become the greatest criminal in the world. He would then present the Los Angeles BB Murder Cases to L as a case that could never be solved.</p>
